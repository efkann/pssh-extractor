## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does this work, any limitations ?

File reading and calculations are done in your browser. So there's no interaction with any server. There's only one limitation. Your file should be under 1MB, generally initialization files are 2-3 KB, so you should be fine. However, if you come across anything different, please create an issue. 

### What does this mean `Failed to extract PSSH from your file` ?

It's possible that you've passed an invalid file. Make sure you use the initialization file. If this error still occurs, feel free to create an issue.

### Why ?

Why not ?



## TODO

- Add tests

- Add a feature to determine PSSH's type (Widevine, Playready)
